## General info
This capstone analyzed U.S. public interest in vaccines using data from the Google Trends API, and explores interest levels across space and time. A predictive ARIMA model was created to forecast interest by state, which could help federal health organizations and national nonprofit organizations to make decisions about where to allocate resources for vaccine education.

## Technologies
The following libraries were used:
*CPython 3.7.4
*IPython 7.8.0
*numpy 1.16.5
*pandas 0.25.1
*matplotlib 3.1.1
*seaborn 0.9.0

## Dataset
‘Health searches by U.S. Metropolitan Area, 2004-2017’ dataset (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/GoogleNewsLab/health-searches-us-county">Google News Lab, 2018<a>)
